==Web Server Sketch Design=====
# leadstor
This is the source code repository and the architectural design document repository.

[Architecture]
We assume to use spring-boot as backend technique.
We use AngularJS as our frontend.
Note: for non-AngularJS front-end tech such as Threadlafe, PageMaker, Dojo etc ,there 
is no essential difference as we put the webui
as resources into our web server. We use AngujarJS as example only. 

[Source Code]
A skeleten for us to implement features here.
